# BiCM_beta

Beta for the BiCM package.

IMPORTANT: This package is in an unstable version. It could be non optimized and yield unexpected errors in some parts.
Apologies for still missing comments and a better logical structure.

This is a Python 3.5 package for the computation of the maximum entropy bipartite configuration model (BiCM) and the projection of bipartite networks on one layer.
In the folder there are 3 files except this readme:
    - "BiCM class", with the bicm object that contains the method to solve the BiCM
    - "functions", that contains the functions callable to solve the BiCM and to calculate the projection
    - "poibin", a package for managing Poisson-Binomial distributions
    - Two tests, a python notebook and a python script
    - Two files for the tests.
